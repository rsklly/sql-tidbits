-- This script is an example lateral flatten of a JSON file, taken from a fake source looking at customer satisfaction surveys. Here we will only be looking at rows where the user filled out the CSAT_score.
-- STEP 1: Explode the '' array.

SELECT id
  , survey_end_time
  , f.value::variant AS response
from user_feedback,

WHERE contains(f.value, 'CSAT_score')
;
-- STEP 2: pull out the various responses to questions.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE responses_flattened AS
